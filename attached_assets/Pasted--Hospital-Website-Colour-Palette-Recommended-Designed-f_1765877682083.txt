📝 Final Combined UI/UX Improvement Request (Hospital)

“I want a frontend UI/UX improvement. The current colours use a cool palette mixed with other inconsistent colour schemes. Since this is a hospital website, the colour palette should be visually comfortable for patients’ eyes and convey cleanliness, trust, and calmness. In addition, the UI/UX should provide a pleasant and reassuring experience that encourages patients to visit the website more frequently and feel confident using its services.”
